			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter a Goth, leading Aaron with his Child in his arms</h2>
			<p class="character">SECOND Goth</p>
			<p class="verseline">Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray’d</p>
			<p class="verseline">To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And as I earnestly did fix mine eye</p>
			<p class="verseline">Upon the wasted building, suddenly</p>
			<p class="verseline">I heard a Child cry underneath a wall.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I made unto the noise, when soon I heard</p>
			<p class="verseline">The crying babe controll’d with this discourse:</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Had nature lent thee but thy mother’s look,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Villain, thou mightst have been an Emperor;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Will hold thee dearly for thy mother’s sake.’</p>
			<p class="verseline">With this, my weapon drawn, I rush’d upon him,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Surpris’d him suddenly, and brought him hither</p>
			<p class="verseline">To use as you think needful of the man.</p>
			<p class="character">Lucius</p>
			<p class="verseline">O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil</p>
			<p class="verseline">That robb’d Andronicus of his good hand;</p>
			<p class="verseline">This is the pearl that pleas’d your Empress’ eye;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And here’s the base fruit of her burning lust.</p>

			<p class="verseline">Why dost not speak? What, deaf? Not a word?</p>

			<p class="verseline">As true a dog as ever fought at head.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I train’d thy brethren to that guileful hole</p>

			<p class="verseline">Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?</p>
			<p class="verseline">I play’d the cheater for thy father’s hand,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, when I had it, drew myself apart</p>
			<p class="verseline">And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I pried me through the crevice of a wall,</p>
			<p class="verseline">When, for his hand, he had his two Sons’ heads;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Beheld his tears, and laugh’d so heartily</p>
			<p class="verseline">That both mine eyes were rainy like to his;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And when I told the Empress of this sport,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Even when their sorrows almost was forgot,</p>
