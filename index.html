<p><b>Titus Andronicus</b> is Shakespeare's first Tragedy. Set against the backdrop of the Roman Empire, it never really gained approval in Victorian England, primarily because of its overuse of violent overtones. Titus Andronicus is the story of Roman general Titus and his thirst for bloody revenge against Tamora Queen of Goths may well qualify as the most violent of Shakespeare plays. In what appears to be a treacherous plot of mindless murder and revenge, Shakespeare's characters namely Titus and Tamora along with their respective supporters revel in plotting a gory and macabre killing spree of each other. The play ends with most central characters dead including Tamora and Titus.</p>
